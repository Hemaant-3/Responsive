            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping
                people to learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It is also important
                for educators to teach ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to
                make it better.[1][2]
                
                Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to
                generation. This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and
                effective citizen.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are different ways to categorize education: for example, by age or
            subject. One way is to divide it into formal education, non-formal education, and informal education.
            
            Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small
            children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school
            and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a
            college or university which may grant an academic degree. Or, students may go to a City college where
            they learn practical skills. This way learners can become qualified to be plumbers, electricians,
            builders and similar occupations. These course have arrangements for students to get practical
            experience. Apprenticeship was the older way to do this,
            
            Non-formal education includes adult basic education, adult literacy education or school equivalency
            preparation. In non-formal education, someone who is not in school can learn to read, write, and other
            basic life or job skills. Home education, individualized instruction (such as programmed learning),
            distance learning and computer-assisted instruction are other possibilities.[3]

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Informal education is less organized.[4] It may be a parent (like a dad
            or mom) teaching a child how to make a meal or ride a bicycle. People can also get an informal education
            by reading many books from a library or educational websites. This may also be called self-education.
            Some famous people have been largely self-educated, like Alfred Russell Wallace.
            
            Unschooling is when kids learn as they go and do not go to traditional school buildings. Instead, they
            go on websites, play games, or engage in normal hobbies and learn along the way. The experience of
            children with "unstructured" lives is that they get into trouble.[5]
            
            Deschooling is a more drastic approach. It advocates abolishing schools. It was put forward in the USA
            of the 1960s and 1970s. It is no longer an active movement.
                Many public schools (U.S. terminology) provide a free education through the government. Parents may send
                their own children to a private school, but they must pay for it. In some poor places, some children
                cannot go to school, because their countries do not make education available, or because their families
                do not have enough money, or because the children have to work for money, or because the society has
                prejudice against education for girls.
